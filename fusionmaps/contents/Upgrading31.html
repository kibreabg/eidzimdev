      <p>All the features of FusionMaps v3.1 are backward compatible with FusionMaps v3.0.7, barring one - exporting maps as images/PDFs. So, if you're not using &quot;Export as image&quot; feature currently, you can just over-write your old chart SWF files with the new ones and the process is complete. However, if you do use the &quot;Export as image&quot; functionality and wish to use the new features of v3.1, please follow the steps below. </p>

    <td valign="top" class="text"><p>Since FusionMaps now allows export of charts at both server and client side, there have been substantial changes in implementation. If you're currently using v3.0.x with server-side saving set as on, you'll need to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Update your map SWF files with the new v3.1 SWF files</li>
        <li>Update your server-side image-saving scripts with the new FusionMaps  Export Handlers (server-side image saving scripts). </li>
        <li>If you intend to save the charts on server, you'll have to configure the parameters in map XML, as well as specify the temporary folder path in server-side FusionMaps Export Handlers.</li>
        <li>To choose another export format for the image, you'll again have to change the  parameter in chart XML.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>If you intend to use the new client-side FusionMaps Exporter Component, please follow the instructions in the section &quot;Exporting as Image/PDF&quot; </p></td>
